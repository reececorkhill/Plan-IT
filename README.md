# PlanIT ðŸ“…
This is the official repository of PlanIT - a JavaScript based working day planner.

Tired of forgetting what you were meant to do whilst at work? Plan your time efficiently with PlanIT! ðŸ“…

## Description

The motivation behind PlanIT was that, as an employee with a busy schedule I found it difficult to keep track of what I was doing at what time during the day. The main aim of this project was to have an application which would allow me to add important events to a daily planner, so I can keep track of what I'm meant to be doing through the day.

There were a few problems which I faced, which led to the planning of this project:

- I had no way of tracking my daily tasks unless I wrote them down ðŸ“”
- If I forgot to pickup my notepad, I lost my daily flow ðŸ‘Ž
- I was going through a lot of paper, frequently ðŸ“–


The solution to these problems was to build an application using JavaScript, Jquery, dayJS, HTML and CSS which would allow me to see time blocks for my standard working day and add a task for each hour, and save it. When I want to update what I have planned for a certain time, I just click into the text area for that hour, update the text and click save and it updates the task. By implementing these features in my code, it has allowed me to manage my time effectively and cut down on my paper use - and it's saved me alot of headaches along the way.

This project has been a great learning experience for me and it's given me the skills to be able to create dynamic web applications that are useful for everyday tasks.
